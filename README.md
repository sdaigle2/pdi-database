# pdi-database
PDI's operations database build in MS access

Getting started as a developer:
1.	Download the frontend: PDI Operations Database_fe.accdb
2.	Download the backend: PDI Operations Database_be-DEV.accdb, note this is a database with dummy information in it.  It can be used for testing.  If you make any changes to it, you will have to create notes as to how to change it in the live copy.
3.	Open PDI Operations Database_fe.accdb
4.	Right click on the log-in screen, and select Design View in order to bypass the broken link tables.
5.	Go to External Data -> Liked Table Manager, select all the tables and press OK.  Point it to where you saved: PDI Operations Database_be-DEV.accdb.  It should say that the linked tables are clean now.
6.	Change the form frmLoginScreen back to Form View.
7.	Log in with the email developer@pdipaxton.com and password pdi
